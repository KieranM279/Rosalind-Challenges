# Intro to Graph Theory (Overlapping graphs)
## Contents
- My solution to the Overlapping graphs problem from Rosalind (OverlapG.py).
- Two example adjacency lists generated by Rosalind.

## Prerequisites
```Python
from Bio import SeqIO
```
## Usage
```Python
# Import the data
sequences = Dictmaker(filename)
# Generate the adjacency list
adjacencyMaker(sequences)
```
## Methods
#### Importing the data
This simply uses the SeqIO.parse() function from SeqIO and isolates the ID and the respective sequence from each FASTA formatted record. It then creates a dictionary of dictionaries, containing the sequence, and the (3 base) prefix and suffix of each sequence.
```Python
def Dictmaker(filename):

    # Parse the data
    records = SeqIO.parse(open(filename),'fasta')
    sequences = {}

    # Loop through the records
    for rec in records:

        # Isolate ID and sequence
        ID = str(rec.id)
        seq = str(rec.seq)

        # Create a dictionary of sequence, prefix and suffix
        data = {'seq':seq,
                'prefix':str(seq[0:3]),
                'suffix':str(seq[-3:-1])+str(seq[-1])}

        # add the dictonary to a dictionary of the IDs
        sequences[ID] = data

    return(sequences)
```
#### Generating the adjacency list
Using a list of the IDs, he function loops through the list of suffixes, it compares each suffix to each prefix, and if there is a match the two IDS are printed to the terminal. If the suffix and prefix come from the same sequence then they are automatically skipped.
```Python
def adjacencyMaker(sequences):

    # Isolate a list of the IDs
    ids = list(sequences.keys())

    # Loop through the suffixes
    for v in ids:
        suf = sequences[v]['suffix']

        # Loop through the prefixes
        for w in ids:
            pre = sequences[w]['prefix']

            # Skip if the prefix and suffix are from the same sequence
            if v == w:
                continue
            # If prefix and suffix match, print them
            elif str(suf) == str(pre):
                print(v + ' ' + w)
```
